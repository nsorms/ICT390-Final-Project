      <h1>Main Components of a Computer</h1>
      <ol id="components">
        <li>CPU</li>
        <li>Motherboard</li>
        <li>RAM</li>
        <li>Hard Drives/Storage</li>
        <li>Video Card</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
        <p>The CPU acts as the brain to the computer, using cores to process bits.
        This handles most of the compute heavy tasks </p>

      <h2>Motherboard</h2>
        <p>The motherboard is a large circuit board that connects all the Components
        together so they can communicate. Most of the</p>

      <h2>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
        <p>RAM is volitile storage, to allow the computer to store open programs
          and tasks there for temporary holding until it is cleared from memory by the user
          or power-loss.</p>

      <h2>Hard Drive/Storage</h2>
        <p>This is where all of your data will be stored for your computer.
          The processor will access it and read the correct the data off of it.
          There are 2 main types of Hard drives: SSDs (Solid State Drive) and HDD
          (Hard Drive). SSDs have no moving parts, and therefor much faster than
          traditional HDDs. HDDs have spinning magnetic disks and a read/write head
          that moves across the disk. With physical moving parts, this style of
          hard drive is much slower in comparison to SSDs. They are limited essentially
          by the speed at which the disks can move.</p>

      <h2>Video Card</h2>
        <p>A video/graphics card is a special piece of hardware that renders images
          very quickly for video playback, video games, and certain process intensive
          tasks that benefit from a GPU (Graphical Processing Unit).
